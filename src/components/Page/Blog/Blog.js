                JavaScript .It is a high-level language.On the other hand nodejs run outside the browser and used on the
                server-side .Node does not have the capability to add html .NOdejs gives us the ability to execute
                javaScript outside the browser.Node is used on the back end development that is server-side
                development.NOdejs is written in C++ while using the v8 engine.Node js is a javaScript runtime for

                <span className='block font-semibold'>Purpose of JWT:</span>
                <span className='block'> JWT used to purpose to share information between two parties securely â€” a
                    client and a server.It's an encoded JSON containing a set of claims and a signature. It's usually
                    used in the context of other authentication mechanisms like OAuth, OpenID to share user-related
                    information. It's also a popular way to authenticate/authorize users in a microservice
                    architecture.</span>
                <span className='block font-semibold'>How does it work:</span>
                <span>
                   When the client app sends a sign in request. In other words, here is where  username/password
                     will travel Once verified, the API will create a JSON Web Token (more on this in a bit) and sign it using a
                    secret key .Then the API will return that token back to the client application
                    Finally, the client app will receive the token, verify it on its own side to make sure it's
                    authentic and then proceed to use it on every subsequent request to authenticate the user without
                    having to send their credentials anymore
